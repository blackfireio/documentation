In this video, we explore :doc:`Analytics </front-end-observability/analytics>`.
The second key feature of Blackfire's front-end observability. Where
:doc:`Browser Monitoring </front-end-observability/browser-monitoring>` focuses
on technical performance metrics, Analytics help you understand user behavior:
How many visits, from where, using what device, and how traffics evolve over time.

So what can you learn with Blackfire analytics?

You get access to detailed metrics like page view, unique visitors and
crawler activity.

You can also identify your most visited pages and transactions.

Analytics shows you referrals and UTM tags so you can track the impact of
marketing campaigns.

And it breaks everything down by devices, browsers, operating systems, countries,
and more.

All of this data is real. And production grade. No fake traffic, no guesses.
It's your real users.

Just like with Browser Monitoring or all Blackfire, Analytics does not track
individuals. We do not store cookies or any personally identifiable information
or P.I.I This means you don't need cookie banners. Your setup is fully G.D.P.R.
compliant by default, and user consent flows remains completely unaffected.
You get clear insight into user activity without compromising trust.

Analytics also shows you where your traffic is coming from, which help you
optimize for slow regions. Compare mobile versus desktop performance and
detect underperforming markets.

A unique feature of analytics is timeframe comparison. It lets you compare two
different time periods to spot trends. You will see how traffic grows over time,
how conversion rates shift, and how seasonal patterns impact your application.
Visual Clue help you quickly spot what changed and where.

Analytics lives in the same dashboard as Browser Monitoring. You can jump from
traffic trends to frontend metrics to backend traces without switching tools.
