If you are a developer, you've probably heard this before. The backend is super
fast, but our users still complain: what's going on? As frustrating as it is,
this concern is often valid.

Backend metrics only tell part of the story. Front-end observability shows how
users actually experience your sites on real devices, in real browsers, out in
the real world.

With Blackfire, frontend observability, you can track real users metrics like
TTFB, FCP, LCP, CLS, and INP. Understand how performance varies across countries,
browsers and devices.

If you are not sure what those metrics even mean, don't worry. I will explain
each one in detail in the following videos.

You might wonder why this matters it matters because users don't care how
optimize your backend is. If the page still takes forever to load, they will
bounce.

JavaScript bloat, third party scripts, layer shifts, slow image CDNs. All these
issues happen on the front end. Blackfire help you detect and fix them as well.

And you can do it all without invading your user's privacy. We do not track
individuals, set cookies, or store any personal data.

This means no cookie banners required. We are fully GDPR compliant by default,
and the features add zero impacts on the user consent flows. You get full
visibility without compromising trust.
