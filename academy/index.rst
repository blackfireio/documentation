Video Transcript
----------------

Welcome and congrats on taking the first step towards mastering continuous
observability with Blackfire.

If you are building decoupled PHP or Python apps, you know, performance issues
can hide in the weirdest places.

That's where Blackfire comes in to help you find those bottlenecks before your
users do, and to make sure you will never deploy your version of your app with
performance regressions

This short course is here to help you get the most out of Blackfire. We will
start with an overview of the product, help you define your observability
strategy, walk you through installation, and guide you in mastering every
feature along the way.

The course is made up of snackable videos each just two to five minutes long, so
it's easy to follow even with a busy schedule.

In about two hours, I'll walk you through it all, step by step. No fluff and no
need to be an observability expert.

So buckle up. Your app is about to become more predictable, stable, and
performant. Let's get started.
