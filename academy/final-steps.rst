And that's a wrap. You made it to the end! Congratulations.

By now you've seen all the ins and outs of Blackfire.

You should have everything you need to get started and take control of your
app's performance, from code to production, without the guesswork.

You've put together your :doc:`observability strategy <introduction/observability-strategy>`,
your better plan to restore, maintain, and enforce the performance of your
applications.

You've explored every Blackfire feature in detail. Now it's time to put them
into action:

1. Start by identifying the most urgent issues using monitoring and continuous profiling.
2. Then dive deeper with deterministic profiling to uncover the root causes.
3. Once you have fixed those bottlenecks, lock in your gains by writing and
   automating performance tests. Start small. Take sustainable steps.

One optimization at a time, you will unlock the full potential of your decoupled
PHP and Python applications.

And if you want to go even further, check out our :doc:`PHP </php/integrations/sdk>`
and :doc:`Python SDKs </python/integrations/sdk>`. They will let you build your
own custom tools and integrations so that you can tailor Blackfire to your exact
needs.

Do you need help along the way? You can reach out to our `support team <https://support.blackfire.io>`_
or join your conversation in our `community on Discord <https://discord.gg/upsun>`_.
You will find direct links to both right from your Blackfire dashboard.

It's now time to crush performance bottlenecks.

**Happy performance optimization**.
