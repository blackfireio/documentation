Today, we are exploring the :doc:`Health Report </monitoring-cookbooks/health-report>`,
your key to staying ahead of application performance trends.

This feature provides an actionable overview of your application health, helping
you make data driven decisions to improve and optimize it. Let's dive in!

The Health Report consolidates key metrics and insights from Blackfire monitoring
and Blackfire builds, the synthetic monitoring, into a single easy to read overview.
It's designed for a specific environment and highlights trends over a seven day
period, comparing them to the previous week.

Here are some of the key metrics you will find in the Health Report:

- **Response time trends**: monitor how your application responds to traffic
  changes.
- **Request and error counts**: stay on top of the user interaction and spot
  potential issues.
- Impactful **recommendations** based on the recent profiles: get tailored advice
  to address bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.
- **Transaction and service analysis:** identify the most impactful or gradually
  degrading transaction and service calls.

Plus, it includes a summary of tests and builds showing you which critical
transactions are not yet protected by performance tests.

To fully unlock the potential of the Health Report, you need to have
:doc:`Blackfire Monitoring </monitoring-cookbooks/index>` enabled on your
environment and we recommend enabling :doc:`periodic builds </builds-cookbooks/builds-periodic>`
as well. This ensures a comprehensive view of your performance metrics and trends.

Some advanced metric, like long-term trends require up to six weeks of data
collection. So, the longer you use Blackfire monitoring and builds, the more
accurate and insightful your Health Report becomes.

Every Monday, you'll receive a summary of your Health Report directly into your
inbox. These updates are sent at 9am based on the time zone configured in your
environment settings.

And don't worry, you can customize your subscription preferences for these
reports anytime.

To start benefitting from Health Report, ensure your application has monitoring
enabled to collect performance data, and periodic builds to test and validate
your application regularly. Run this for at least 14 days to generate your first
complete report.

The Blackfire Health Report is your weekly check up, ensuring your application
stays robust, responsive, and ready for anything.

Start using it today and take control of your performance journey.
