Testing Cookbooks
=================

Performance testing is key to developing reliable software. It ensures your
application can handle user traffic and workload, proactively identifying issues
before they become problems.

Blackfire provides a comprehensive testing suite that lets you:

- Define expectations for HTTP requests and CLI
- Automatically evaluate assertions with every profile made
- Secure the critical user journey with synthetic monitoring
- Integrate the tests with your CI/CD pipeline

You can spot bottlenecks and understand the impact of changes before they go live.
