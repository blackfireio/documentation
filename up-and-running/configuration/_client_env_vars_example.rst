You can set these environment variables in the local ``.env`` file of your
project if supported. Alternatively,  you can set them in your global shell
configuration file (such as ``~/.bashrc`` or ``~/.zshrc``):

.. code-block:: bash

    export BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID=xxx
    export BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_TOKEN=yyy
    export BLACKFIRE_LOG_LEVEL=4
    export BLACKFIRE_LOG_FILE=/tmp/probe.log
