What is Blackfire?
==================

Welcome to **Blackfire**, your *Continuous Observability Solution*.

Blackfire empowers your to monitor your applications' real-time behavior and
proactively identify existing bottlenecks or the consequences of upcoming changes
before they reach production.

By speeding up the discovery process and allowing long-term performance
optimization, Blackfire lets you stay in control, even during crises, to build
and grow your applications confidently.

Blackfire provides a comprehensive view of performance issues, allowing you to
quickly drill down from a high-level overview to pinpoint root causes at the
function or service call level.

Across all of your sites and testing pipelines, get actionable reports and
insights, which help you fix issues and enforce long-last improvements.

Blackfire helps you to improve web applications' performance at each step of its
lifecycle: from development to test, staging and production.

Continuous Profiling
--------------------

Blackfire's :doc:`continuous profiling </continuous-profiling-cookbooks/index>`
let you maximize performance efficiency with real-time insights:

- Quickly identify performance bottlenecks and improve the most resource-intensive
  parts of your applications.
- Benefit from low overhead and holistic observability.
- Immediate bottleneck identification with continuous monitoring of yourÂ£
  application and analysis of code execution.

Monitoring
----------

:doc:`Monitoring </monitoring-cookbooks/index>` a web application is about
collecting performance metrics on live traffic, usually in production, sometimes
in staging.

It is a key feature to **detect when something is going wrong** in your application,
and give you high-level pointers to **understand which transaction is consuming
most of the server resources**. Blackfire also breaks down that information into
time spent within the application, and time spent within external services (eg
HTTP, SQL, Queues, etc.).

To avoid impacting your end-users the metric collection techniques ensure a very
light, or even non-existing overhead. It also means that the depth of metrics
is limited. This is where our profiler shines.

Profiling
---------

Blackfire's :doc:`Deterministic profiler </profiling-cookbooks/index>` collects
deep performance metrics while the code is running, and have full details and
context on the code's behavior to **find the root cause of performance bottlenecks**.

A profile includes information on the number of calls per function, caller-callee
relationships, wall-time, I/O time, CPU time, memory, network, HTTP calls and
SQL queries. Two visualization options, the call-graph and the timeline, let you
view the code's behavior as a relational graph, or across time.

A key advantage of Blackfire's profiler technology is that **it can run safely in
production**, with **no impact for end-users** when profiling HTTP requests. By
default, profiles run on synthetic requests, generating no overhead on real
traffic.

Blackfire also offers more advanced profiling techniques, which you can discover
in this documentation (real end-user requests, crons, scripts, and more).

Testing
-------

Beyond traditional monitoring, and profiling techniques, Blackfire offers unique
features to let you integrate :doc:`performance testing </builds-cookbooks/scenarios>`
anywhere in your QA practices. :doc:`Integrate </integrations/index>` with
CI/CD, unit tests, tests upon deployment, or run Synthetic User Monitoring.

Write :doc:`assertions </testing-cookbooks/assertions>` to verify that your code
behaves as expected, and that it respects your performance budget.

Benefit from default assertions, our fully documented **recommendations**, to
have Blackfire warn you with no further effort from you when it detects
something wrong in the performance, quality or security of your code.

A Unique Blend of Features
--------------------------

Blackfire is the only tool to offer natively integrated monitoring, advanced
determinist and continuous profiling and testing features. Thanks to that blend,
get actionable insights and reports so that you can fix issues rather than
spend time finding them.

To better understand how Blackfire works, check our doc on
:doc:`the Blackfire stack </reference-guide/faq>`.
