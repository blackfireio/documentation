Monitoring Cookbooks
====================

Blackfire Monitoring enables to monitor the performance of a deployed
application, usually in production or staging environments.

While visitors and users of the application browse through it, Blackfire
Monitoring collects performance metrics in real-time on the executed PHP code.

The collected metrics are rendered and displayed on Blackfire.io to help you
detect performance issues, find their root cause, and get actionable
recommendations to optimize the performance, quality, and security of your
application.

Blackfire Monitoring is fully integrated with Blackfire Profiler, enabling
:doc:`automated profiling </monitoring-cookbooks/automatic-profiling>`, and
providing enhanced :doc:`Health Reports </monitoring-cookbooks/health-report>`.
