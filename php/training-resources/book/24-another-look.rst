Let's quickly review Blackfire's role at each of these stages.

Using Blackfire during Development
----------------------------------

During development, developers can use Blackfire as a super-charged profiler on
their local machines to:

* Debug identified performance problems (coming from monitoring alerts in
  production for instance);

* Measure and improve performance by spotting performance bottlenecks;

* Write tests to set a performance budget and avoid regressions (both unit
  tests and scenarios);

* Validate code changes when adding new features and fixing bugs by comparing
  profiles;

* Understand code behavior of unknown codebases at runtime;

* Fix quality or security issues discovered via Blackfire's recommendations.

Using Blackfire on Testing Servers
----------------------------------

On integration servers, Blackfire helps automate performance management by:

* Running tests to continuously check code behavior and performance sensitive
  functions;

* Running integration scenarios to find regressions and check the performance
  budget.

Using Blackfire on Staging Servers
----------------------------------

If you have access to a staging environment that replicates the production one,
Blackfire can be used to:

* Validate performance improvements;

* Run integration tests with production-like data;

* Decide when code is ready to be deployed to production.

Using Blackfire on Production Servers
-------------------------------------

On production servers, Blackfire is complementary to the monitoring system you
already have in place. It allows you to:

* Identify the root causes of performance issues;

* Understand how your code behaves under stress;

* Find security issues even if no code changed (new vulnerabilities discovered
  in PHP for instance).

Conclusion
----------

Blackfire is a unique SaaS-delivered Performance Management Solution; it allows
your development and DevOps teams to measure, compare, and improve performance
at every step of the application development lifecycle.
