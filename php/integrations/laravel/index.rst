Laravel [language: PHP]
=======================

By default, **Blackfire works seamlessly with any application built with Laravel**,
like any PHP application.

:doc:`Install Blackfire for PHP </install/php>`.

However, in some cases, you may want to go further and :doc:`monitor messages
processing </php/integrations/laravel/horizon>` or :doc:`monitor Artisan commands
</php/integrations/laravel/artisan>`.

For these advanced cases, the Blackfire PHP SDK provides the following integrations
with Laravel:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    artisan
    horizon
    tests
    octane
