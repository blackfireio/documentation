=======================

By default, **Blackfire works seamlessly with any application built with Symfony**,
like any PHP application.

:doc:`Install Blackfire for PHP </install/php>`.

However, in some cases, you may want to go further and :doc:`programmatically
trigger profiles </php/integrations/symfony/http-client>`, :doc:`monitor messages
processing </php/integrations/symfony/messenger>` or even :doc:`use your
functional tests with Blackfire Builds </php/integrations/symfony/functional-tests>`.

For these advanced cases, the Blackfire PHP SDK provides the following integrations
with Symfony:
