The PHP API is also commonly referred to as the "Public API".
Currently it exposes a Repository which allows you to create, read, update,
manage and delete all objects available in Ibexa, first and foremost content,
but also related objects like Sections, Locations, Content Types, Content Type groups, languages and so on.
You can read more at `Ibexa Public PHP API`_
