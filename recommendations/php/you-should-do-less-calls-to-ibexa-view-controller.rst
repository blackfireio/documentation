Ibexa comes with a native controller to display your content, known as the ViewController.
It is called each time you try to reach a Content item from its Url Alias
(human readable, translatable URI generated for any content based on URL patterns defined per Content Type)
and is able to render any content previously edited in the admin interface or via the Public API Guide.

For more information please read `Content Rendering`_.
