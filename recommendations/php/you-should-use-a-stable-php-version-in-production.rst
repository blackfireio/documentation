You should use a stable PHP version in production
=================================================

The PHP project, as most popular open source projects do, publishes several
unstable versions before releasing any major new version. These unstable
versions are called "alpha", "beta" and "Release Candidate" (RC).

The unstable versions (e.g. "7.2.0-RC2" or "7.3.0-beta1") are released so
other projects and companies can test them in their real applications before
the stable version is released.

You should never use these versions in production because they may contain bugs
and performance issues already solved in the stable versions and because they
are no longer maintained after the stable versions are released.
