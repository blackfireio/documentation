Your priority
=============

Your priority in the very first days of using Blackfire depends on your role
in the :term:`organization <Organization>`.

Organization Owner or Admin
---------------------------

As an organization owner or admin, your primary objective is to ensure that your
teams have access to everything they need to use Blackfire to its full potential.

You may not be the one using Blackfire daily, but you will be responsible for
inviting your team members to your Blackfire organization, granting admin and
manager permissions to ensure operations run smoothly, and ensuring that your
teams have access to everything they need to use Blackfire to its full capacity.

Our centralized access management system allows you to monitor who gets access
to what at all times, allowing you to take action quickly if needed.
