Introduction to Continuous Profiling [level: Production]
========================================================

:doc:`Continuous profiling </continuous-profiling-cookbooks/index>` is a powerful
observability feature combining profiling and monitoring with minimal overhead.

The Blackfire continuous profiler periodically captures data at specified
intervals to gather information on the functions or services triggered by any
active request or script.

It enables developers to gain detailed insights into their application's
behavior, identify bottlenecks, and optimize code for better performance and
resource utilization.

This proactive and holistic approach allows for quicker identification and
resolution of performance issues, ensuring the smooth running of software in
live environments.
