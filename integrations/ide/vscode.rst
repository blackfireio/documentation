Visual Studio Code [language: PHP]
==================================

The `PHP Intelephense extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio
.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client>`_ for Visual Studio
Code provides stubs for ``\BlackfireProbe`` internal class, from
:ref:`the Blackfire extension <php-blackfireprobe-internal-class>`.
These stubs give you **code completion on all available methods of
\BlackfireProbe class**.
