Laravel Vapor
=============

Thanks to our :doc:`AWS Lambda support </integrations/paas/aws-lambda>`, Blackfire
can also be deployed on Laravel Vapor. 

The official documentation to install Blackfire on Vapor is pending. For now, we
recommend `Alex Vanderbist's cookbook
<https://flareapp.io/blog/8-installing-blackfire-on-laravel-vapor#putting-one-and-two-together>`_.
