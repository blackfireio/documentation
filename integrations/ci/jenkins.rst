Jenkins [level: Production]
===========================

If you are using Jenkins for your continuous integration workflow, you can
trigger Blackfire scenarios via the :ref:`builds webhook endpoint
<build-webhook>`.

Using Jenkins is also a great way to get notifications when integrating
Blackfire with :doc:`PHPUnit </php/integrations/phpunit>`.
